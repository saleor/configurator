üì£ Saleor Configurator v0.11.0 - Enhanced Error Handling

Hey team! We've shipped a major improvement to error handling that makes debugging significantly easier.

**What Changed:**
‚Ä¢ Added ErrorRecoveryGuide system with 30+ error patterns
‚Ä¢ Extended ServiceErrorWrapper to 80% of services  
‚Ä¢ All errors now include actionable recovery steps
‚Ä¢ Fixed page type reference attribute validation

**Real Example - Before:**
‚ùå Error: Invalid token

**Real Example - After:**
‚ùå Deployment failed: Authentication Error

Suggested actions:
  1. Verify your API token is correct: --token YOUR_TOKEN
  2. Check token permissions in Saleor dashboard
  3. Generate a new token if the current one is expired

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# Try with invalid token to see new error handling
pnpm dlx @saleor/configurator deploy \
  --url https://demo.saleor.io \
  --token INVALID
```

**Impact:**
‚Ä¢ 577 tests passing
‚Ä¢ 30+ error scenarios covered
‚Ä¢ 80% service coverage

## Team Update Version

```
üëã Team Update: Configurator Error Handling Overhaul

We just merged a significant improvement to how the Saleor Configurator handles and reports errors.

**The Problem:**
Users were getting cryptic error messages like "Channel not found" with no guidance on how to fix them.

**The Solution:**
Every error now includes:
‚úÖ What went wrong
‚úÖ How to fix it
‚úÖ Which commands to run
‚úÖ Relevant documentation links

**Example:**
When a warehouse slug doesn't match, instead of just failing, users now see:
- The exact warehouse that wasn't found
- That slugs are case-sensitive
- The command to list existing warehouses
- How to update their configuration

This should significantly reduce support requests and make the tool more self-service.

Test it out and let me know if you hit any issues!
