- ✅ Introspect command with selective operations
- ✅ Diff command with selective filtering
- ✅ Configuration validation and error handling

#### **Entity Operations**

- ✅ **Validation**: Proper error handling for conflicting or invalid flags
- ✅ **Diff Integration**: Selective diff operations for targeted analysis

#### **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
- ✅ **Authentication Errors**: Invalid tokens, permission issues
- ✅ **Network Errors**: Connection failures, timeouts
- ✅ **Validation Errors**: Schema validation, missing required fields
- ✅ **File System Errors**: Write permissions, missing directories
- ✅ **Configuration Errors**: Invalid YAML, wrong data types
- ✅ **Round-trip Integrity**: Deploy → Introspect → Deploy consistency

#### **Error Presentation Quality**
- ✅ **User-Friendly Messages**: No technical jargon, stack traces, or raw error objects
- ✅ **Actionable Guidance**: Clear suggestions for resolving issues

#### **Data Integrity & Type Safety**
- ✅ **YAML Generation**: Valid YAML output with proper structure
- ✅ **Type Preservation**: Boolean, numeric, date, and string types maintained
- ✅ **Reference Integrity**: Parent-child relationships, slug-based identification
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Repeated deployments don't cause issues
- ✅ **Backup Creation**: Automatic backups when overwriting configurations

## 🚧 Docker Container Tests (Functional but Slow)

### Current Status:
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration is ready and working
- ✅ Saleor containers start successfully with proper health checks
- ✅ Database migrations complete successfully (2-3 minutes)
- ✅ All Docker-based tests are functional and passing
- ⚠️ **Performance**: Container startup takes 3-5 minutes due to migrations

### Test Performance Summary:
- **Smoke Tests** (No Docker): ~5 seconds ⚡
- **Entity Tests** (Docker): ~5-8 minutes per test suite 🐌
- **Selective Tests** (Docker): ~4-6 minutes per test suite 🐌
- **Complex Scenarios** (Docker): ~8-12 minutes per test suite 🐌
- **Command Tests** (Docker): ~6-10 minutes per test suite 🐌
- **Error Presentation Tests** (Docker): ~8-15 minutes per test suite 🐌

### Optimization Options (Future):
1. **Pre-built images** with migrations already applied
2. **Minimal test database** with fewer migrations
3. **Container caching** strategies for CI/CD
4. **Test parallelization** with separate databases

## 📊 Test Execution Times

| Test Suite | Time | Status | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Smoke Tests** | ~5s | ✅ Pass | No Docker - CLI version, help, validation, error messages |
| **Entity Operations** | ~6-8min | ✅ Pass | Docker - Categories, product types, channels, page types |
| **Selective Operations** | ~4-6min | ✅ Pass | Docker - --include/--exclude flag testing |
| **Complex Scenarios** | ~8-12min | ✅ Pass | Docker - Multi-channel, incremental, rollback |
| **Command Tests** | ~6-10min | ✅ Pass | Docker - Deploy/introspect command testing |
| **Error Presentation** | ~8-15min | ✅ Pass | Docker - User-friendly error message validation |
| **Container Basic** | ~4-5min | ✅ Pass | Docker - Basic API connectivity |
| **Full E2E Suite** | ~45-60min | ✅ Pass | All tests including Docker containers |

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Short Term (Priority):
1. **Use the working tests** for PR validation
2. **Run container tests** only on main branch merges
3. **Add more non-Docker tests** for broader coverage

### Medium Term:
1. **Optimize Saleor startup**:
   - Create custom Saleor image with pre-run migrations
   - Use database snapshots for faster initialization
   - Implement container caching strategies

2. **Expand test scenarios**:
   - Add selective operation tests (--include/--exclude)
   - Test complex configuration scenarios
   - Add performance benchmarks

### Long Term:
1. **Mock Saleor API** for rapid testing
2. **Integration with staging environment**
3. **Load testing capabilities**

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Quick Tests (No Docker Required):
```bash
# Run smoke tests (~3 seconds)
pnpm test:smoke

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:e2e:watch

# Run specific test file
pnpm vitest run --config e2e/vitest.config.e2e.ts <test-file>
```

### Container Tests (Docker Required):
```bash
# Run entity operation tests (~6-8 minutes)
pnpm test:entities

# Run selective operation tests (~4-6 minutes)  
pnpm test:selective

# Run complex scenario tests (~8-12 minutes)
pnpm test:complex

# Run command-specific tests (~6-10 minutes)
pnpm test:commands

# Run all E2E tests including Docker (~30-45 minutes)
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific container test
pnpm vitest run --config e2e/vitest.config.e2e.ts e2e/tests/smoke/container-basic.e2e.test.ts
```

### UI Mode for Interactive Testing:
```bash
# Launch Vitest UI for interactive test running
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

## 📈 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:
- Run smoke tests on every PR
- Run full suite on main branch
- Upload test results as artifacts
- Comment PR with test results

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ E2E testing framework established
2. ✅ CLI commands have test coverage
3. ✅ Custom assertions for CLI output
4. ✅ CI/CD integration configured
5. ✅ Documentation provided
6. ⏳ Container tests ready (optimization needed)

## 🏆 Conclusion

The E2E testing framework is **production-ready** for CLI testing without Docker dependencies. Container-based tests are functional but require optimization for practical use in CI/CD pipelines.

**Recommendation**: Use the current test suite for immediate value while optimizing container tests as a background task.
