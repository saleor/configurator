# Clean up feat/add-missing-attributes branch

## Git Operations Performed

### Branch Management
- Created backup copy: `feat/add-missing-attributes-backup`
- Reset to merge commit `a639826` to clean commit history
- Removed infrastructure cleanup commit to isolate core changes

### File Cleanup
- Deleted Docker/K8s configurations (`Dockerfile`, `k8s/configurator.yaml`)
- Removed documentation files (`AI_LLM_INDEX.md`, `CONFIGURATOR_GUIDE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, etc.)
- Cleaned build artifacts (`package-lock.json`, `.DS_Store`)

### Rebase Attempt
- Attempted rebase against main but encountered extensive merge conflicts
- Conflicts in: `README.md`, `service-container.ts`, `attribute-service.ts`, `config/schema.ts`, product module files
- Aborted rebase due to ~14k lines of changes across 52 files

### Product Module Comparison
- Analyzed differences between main and backup branch product modules
- Main: Clean, focused implementation for current development phase
- Backup: Advanced implementation with dependency injection and channel management
- Both versions are functional but serve different development stages

### Current State
- Working branch contains all new modules and enhancements
- Infrastructure removed, core functionality preserved
- Ready for systematic module integration or alternative merge strategy
