# Slide 3: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges - With Source References

## Based on Actual Discovery Session Materials

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Fragmented B2B markets with no unified platform - the goal is connecting wholesalers and retailers digitally across Sudan and Saudi Arabia replacing manual processes.

â€¢ Vendors can't manage their own catalogs
  [FROM EXCALIDRAW: "Vendor management of their own catalog" listed as obstacle]
  [FROM EXCALIDRAW: "Vendor managing their own catalog" as architecture component]
  â€¢ Each vendor updates prices manually, no digital inventory â†’ retailers waste hours finding products

â€¢ No price transparency between vendors  
  [FROM EXCALIDRAW: "ridamart offer: 5$" vs "X vendor offer: 4.5$" showing price competition]
  [FROM APPROACH DOC: "Shared product catalog with vendor-specific variants"]
  â€¢ Same sugar: RidaMart $5, Vendor X $4.50 â†’ but retailers can't see all options, no competition

â€¢ Payment infrastructure doesn't exist in Sudan
  [FROM EXCALIDRAW: "Wallet = own payment solution" as key outcome]
  [FROM APPROACH DOC: "Sudan: Custom wallet system (due to limited payment gateways)"]
  [FROM EXCALIDRAW: "Cash on delivery" and "P2P wallets" as payment methods]
  â€¢ No cards, limited banks, cash is dangerous â†’ need unified wallet or stuck at 100 orders/day

â€¢ Orders fail when prices change daily
  [FROM APPROACH DOC: "Order modification after placement (price/availability changes)"]
  [FROM APPROACH DOC: "Price update approval workflow" as customization needed]
  â€¢ Hyperinflation means today's price wrong tomorrow â†’ 30% orders cancelled without modification flow

## Final Version with Authentic Language:

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Building super app but B2B markets still use WhatsApp - goal is unified platform connecting Sudan and Saudi Arabia digitally, starting with 50+ wholesalers.

â€¢ Vendors can't manage their own catalogs digitally
  [EXCALIDRAW: Main obstacle identified]
  â€¢ Everything on Excel and WhatsApp, no inventory sync â†’ retailers calling 10 vendors for one product

â€¢ Price competition impossible without transparency
  [EXCALIDRAW: Shows RidaMart $5 vs Vendor $4.50 for same sugar]  
  â€¢ Retailers can't compare offers, vendors can't compete â†’ market stays inefficient, prices 20% higher

â€¢ Sudan has no payment infrastructure
  [EXCALIDRAW: "Wallet = own payment solution" + "P2P wallets"]
  â€¢ No cards, banks limited, cash trucks risky â†’ must build wallet system from scratch

â€¢ Daily price changes break orders
  [APPROACH DOC: "Order modification after placement" requirement]
  â€¢ Hyperinflation means prices jump overnight â†’ need approval workflow or 30% orders fail
