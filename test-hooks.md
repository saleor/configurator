# Test file for Git hooks

This file is used to test the various Git hooks we've implemented:

- Pre-commit: Lint + typecheck
- Commit-msg: Conventional commits validation  
- Pre-push: Test + build + audit
- Post-merge/checkout: Automation

## Test Results

All hooks should work correctly and provide helpful feedback.

## Second Test

Testing commit message validation.
