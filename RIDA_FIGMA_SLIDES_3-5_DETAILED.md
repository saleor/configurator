## SLIDE 3: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

### Template-Consistent Layout

**Main Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

**Left Column Content (with red/orange bullet indicators):**

ðŸ”´ **Fragmented systems block unified checkout and fan insight**
- the goal is one extensible commerce layer across tickets, merch, F&B, and memberships to create true 360 view of the fan
  
ðŸ”´ **No unified catalog or checkout**
- Each vertical (tickets, merch, F&B, memberships) runs its own products, inventory, and payments â†’ fragmented fan journey

ðŸ”´ **Bundles & blended offers are difficult**
- Packaging ticket + jersey + food credit + membership requires spanning 3-4 systems and rules â†’ blocks revenue growth

ðŸ”´ **Payments are fragmented**
- Multiple gateways (Ticketmaster, Shift4, Stripe) â†’ no unified checkout, higher fees, and partner lock-in

ðŸ”´ **Subscriptions & renewals are complex**
- Season tickets, payment plans, opt-outs, and resale eligibility live in Archtics + manual CRM flows â†’ fragile and high-risk

**Right Column (Quote Box with Rida branding):**
```
