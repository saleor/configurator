```

## üí° **Enhance Existing Sticky Notes:**

The ones you have are good! Consider adding:

1. **"b2b amazon"** note - Add timeline: "(6 weeks MVP)"
2. **"multi-vendor setup"** - Add specific: "(5-10 wholesalers)"
3. **"rida will be one of the vendors"** - Add: "dog-fooding approach"
4. **"unique setup per each region"** - Add: "(Khartoum, Riyadh)"

## üìä **Optional Enhancement - Add Success Metrics:**

Small text box in corner:
```
Success = 
‚Ä¢ Launch in 6 weeks
‚Ä¢ 50+ vendors onboarded
‚Ä¢ 500+ retailers active
‚Ä¢ 1000+ monthly orders
‚Ä¢ $1M+ GMV
```

## üé® **Visual Suggestions:**

1. **Color-code by priority:**
   - Yellow = Timeline/MVP
   - Green = Scale/Growth
   - Blue = Technical
   - Purple = Business targets
   - Orange = Regional/Payment

2. **Add connecting lines** between related notes:
   - Connect "b2b amazon" ‚Üí "multi-vendor" ‚Üí "marketplace orchestrator"
   - Connect "unique setup" ‚Üí regions

3. **Size variation**: Make "6 weeks MVP" note slightly larger (most critical)
