# Slide 3: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges
## Authentic, Specific Problems from Discovery Session

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Building super app but stuck with WhatsApp orders - the goal is digital B2B commerce connecting Sudan and Saudi wholesalers with thousands of retailers needing daily essentials.

â€¢ No way for vendors to manage their catalogs
  â€¢ Each wholesaler uses Excel sheets, WhatsApp groups, phone calls â†’ retailers spend hours just finding who has sugar in stock today.

â€¢ Retailers can't see competing prices 
  â€¢ RidaMart sells sugar at $5, another vendor at $4.50 â†’ retailers don't know, so they overpay and vendors can't compete properly.

â€¢ Sudan has zero digital payment infrastructure
  â€¢ No credit cards, limited bank access, people use P2P apps for everything â†’ forcing cash means trucks carry money, not just goods.

â€¢ Hyperinflation means prices change daily
  â€¢ Sudan prices jump 10-20% overnight, orders placed yesterday are wrong today â†’ vendors reject orders or demand new prices after delivery.

## Even More Direct Version (What Nazar Actually Said):

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Want to be Amazon for B2B but regions have different rules - goal is connecting 50+ wholesalers with 500+ retailers across Sudan and Saudi Arabia borders.

â€¢ Vendors can't digitize their warehouses
  â€¢ "Vendor managing their own catalog" is impossible today, everything manual â†’ lost sales when stock exists but nobody knows.

â€¢ "Same product, different vendor prices" invisible
  â€¢ Sugar from RidaMart ($5) vs Vendor X ($4.50) but retailers can't compare â†’ no competition, prices stay high, inefficient market.

â€¢ Sudan runs on cash but that's dangerous
  â€¢ Drivers carry $10K+ in cash, no wallet system exists, BankAK and MBok don't talk â†’ need unified wallet or growth stops.

â€¢ Orders break when prices change overnight
  â€¢ Place order for 100 bags sugar Monday at $5, Tuesday it's $6, vendor wants new price â†’ "approval workflow" needed or orders fail.

## Final Version - Natural Language from Discovery:

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Fragmented markets mean wholesalers and retailers can't connect - goal is unified B2B platform from Khartoum to Riyadh replacing WhatsApp with real commerce.

â€¢ Vendors stuck with manual catalog management
  â€¢ 50+ wholesalers updating prices on WhatsApp daily, no inventory sync â†’ retailers calling 10 vendors to find one bag of rice.

â€¢ No price transparency kills competition
  â€¢ Sugar: RidaMart $5, Vendor A $4.50, Vendor B $5.50 but hidden â†’ retailers overpay 20%, vendors can't compete on price.

â€¢ Cash-only in Sudan, fragmented payments in Saudi  
  â€¢ No cards in Sudan, drivers carry cash bags, Saudi has 5+ gateways â†’ need wallet system or can't scale beyond 100 orders/day.

â€¢ Daily price swings break traditional ordering
  â€¢ Sudan inflation 20% monthly, prices invalid after 24 hours â†’ orders need modification workflow or 30% get cancelled.
