## SLIDE 4: Rida Technologies' Needs + How Saleor Supports You

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Needs + How Saleor Supports You

| **Rida Technologies' Needs** | **How Saleor Cloud supports it** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Multi-Vendor Marketplace** | Product catalog with vendor variants (RidaMart $5, Vendor X $4.50). Saleor's GraphQL API unifies all vendor offers into one searchable schema. |
| **Vendor Catalog Management** | Each vendor manages their own inventory via dashboard or API. Real-time stock updates, bulk price changes, no more WhatsApp/Excel. |
| **Regional Sub-Divisions** | Channels for Sudan/Saudi Arabia with metadata for regions (Khartoum, Riyadh). Custom logic for sub-regional policies and delivery zones. |
| **Wallet Payment System** | Saleor's payment plugin architecture enables custom wallet for Sudan. P2P top-ups, balance tracking, works offline with sync later. |
| **Order Modification Flow** | Webhook-driven approval when prices change overnight. Vendor can request new price, retailer approves/rejects, handles hyperinflation. |
