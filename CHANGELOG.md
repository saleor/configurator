# saleor-configurator

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ea1a819: Add `isShippingRequired` field to product type

  Product types now support the `isShippingRequired` boolean field to control whether products of this type require shipping. This defaults to `false` (unshippable by default).

  **Example:**

  ```yaml
  productTypes:
    - name: Book
      isShippingRequired: true
    - name: E-Book
      isShippingRequired: false
  ```

- ea1a819: Improve attribute duplicate handling

  Enhanced attribute handling to prevent duplicate definitions and encourage the use of reference syntax:

  - Added `DuplicateAttributeDefinitionError` for better error messaging when attributes are defined multiple times
  - Check for existing attributes globally before creating new ones
  - Suggest using reference syntax (`attribute: "AttributeName"`) when attributes already exist elsewhere
  - Allow full attribute input once, but encourage references for reuse

  This prevents conflicts and promotes better configuration practices by encouraging attribute reuse through the reference syntax.

### Patch Changes

- 7bfe8d9: Fixed the issue where channelListings are required for a variant.
- eeb25d3: Fixed the issue where the reference attribute syntax didn't work for page types. From now on, you can reference existing attributes in page types the same way as in product types.
- ea1a819: Remove support for description field in products

  The description field has been removed from the product schema as it was not being used by the product service. This simplifies the product configuration and removes unused fields.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a42da43: Fixed introspect command diff perspective to correctly show changes from remote to local configuration. Added selective filtering with --include/--exclude options, CI mode for automation, and multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML). Enhanced user experience with actionable error messages, progress indicators, confirmation prompts with change summaries, and operation timing. Added --backup flag (defaults to true) and --verbose mode.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b9a651: Improved error messages. Now, Configurator should provide helpful error messages when distinguishing different types of errors (schema validation, GraphQL, configuration logic etc.).
- da7641e: Fixed the error when schema validation didn't see `null` as a correct value for some of the shop settings.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 110c477: Extend product type attributes to include variant attributes

  Now, instead of one `attributes` key (which pointed to product attributes), you can define both `productAttributes` and `variantAttributes` in the config.

- 110c477: Added referencing existing attributes by name

  Instead of providing the same attribute input several times, you can now declare it once and reference it by name in the product type input.

  **Example:**

  ```yaml
  productTypes:
    - name: Book
      productAttributes:
        - name: Author
          inputType: PLAIN_TEXT
        - name: Genre
          inputType: DROPDOWN
          values:
            - name: Fiction
            - name: Non-Fiction
            - name: Fantasy
    - name: E-Book
      productAttributes:
        - attribute: Author # Reference an existing attribute by slug
        - attribute: Genre # Reference an existing attribute by slug
        - name: File Format # New attribute
          inputType: DROPDOWN
          values:
            - name: PDF
            - name: EPUB
            - name: MOBI
  ```
