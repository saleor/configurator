# saleor-configurator

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 110c477: Extend product type attributes to include variant attributes

  Now, instead of one `attributes` key (which pointed to product attributes), you can define both `productAttributes` and `variantAttributes` in the config.

- 110c477: Added referencing existing attributes by name

  Instead of providing the same attribute input several times, you can now declare it once and reference it by name in the product type input.

  **Example:**

  ```yaml
  productTypes:
    - name: Book
      productAttributes:
        - name: Author
          inputType: PLAIN_TEXT
        - name: Genre
          inputType: DROPDOWN
          values:
            - name: Fiction
            - name: Non-Fiction
            - name: Fantasy
    - name: E-Book
      productAttributes:
        - attribute: Author # Reference an existing attribute by slug
        - attribute: Genre # Reference an existing attribute by slug
        - name: File Format # New attribute
          inputType: DROPDOWN
          values:
            - name: PDF
            - name: EPUB
            - name: MOBI
  ```
