# Rida Technologies - Figma Template Consistency Guide

## Template Structure Analysis

Based on reviewing slides 3-4, the template follows a consistent visual pattern that should be maintained across all slides:

### Core Visual Elements

1. **Black background** with subtle geometric patterns
2. **Two-column layout** for comparison slides
3. **Color-coded headers** (Green for positive/Saleor features, Red for challenges/needs)
4. **Bullet points** with colored indicators
5. **Bottom highlight boxes** with key takeaways
6. **Chicago Blackhawks logo** placement (to be replaced with Rida logo)

## Template Patterns by Slide Type

### Pattern 1: Challenge/Solution Slides (Like Slide 3)
**Structure:**
- Title: "[Company]'s Key Challenges"
- Left side: Challenge list with red bullet points
- Right side: Quote or highlight box
- Bottom: Analytics/metrics insight

### Pattern 2: Comparison Slides (Like Slide 4)
**Structure:**
- Title: "[Company]'s Needs + How Saleor Supports You"
- Two-column table with colored headers
- Left column: Company needs (neutral/red tone)
- Right column: Saleor solutions (green tone)
- Bottom: Two highlight boxes with key points

## Slide-by-Slide Consistency Recommendations

### SLIDE 3: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges
**Keep Template Structure, Update Content:**

```
Title: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

Left Column (Red bullets):
‚ö´ Fragmented markets block cross-border B2B trade
  ‚Ä¢ No unified platform connecting Sudan and Saudi Arabia
  ‚Ä¢ Limited price transparency between wholesalers

‚ö´ No unified payment infrastructure  
  ‚Ä¢ Cash-dominant markets with no digital wallets
  ‚Ä¢ Cross-border payment complications

‚ö´ Logistics infrastructure is minimal
  ‚Ä¢ No last-mile delivery network established
  ‚Ä¢ Manual coordination between suppliers and retailers

‚ö´ Hyperinflation demands price flexibility
  ‚Ä¢ Daily price updates required in Sudan
  ‚Ä¢ Need approval workflows for price changes

Right Column (Quote box):
"Building the Amazon for B2B in MENA requires a 
platform that can handle multi-vendor competition,
regional complexities, and rapid scaling."

Bottom highlight:
Better analytics, targeting, and a 
unified platform across all markets.
```

- **Gray (#6B7280)** ‚Üí Keep for secondary text

### Usage Guidelines:
1. **Headers**: Use blue for Rida sections, green for Saleor/solutions
2. **Bullets**: Match color to content type (challenges=red/orange, solutions=green, neutral=blue)
3. **Highlight boxes**: Blue border with subtle gradient
4. **Charts/metrics**: Use brand palette consistently

## Typography Consistency

### Font Hierarchy:
- **Slide titles**: 48px, Bold, White
