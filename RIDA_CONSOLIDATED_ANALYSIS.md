### Data Model Implementation

```yaml
# Saleor Configuration Approach
Channels:
  - name: "Saudi Arabia"
    currency: "SAR"
    metadata:
      regions: ["Eastern", "Western", "Riyadh"]
      
  - name: "Sudan"
    currency: "SDG"
    metadata:
      regions: ["Khartoum", "Port Sudan", "Kassala"]

Products:
  - Base product (e.g., "Sugar 25kg")
  - Variants per vendor with:
    - SKU: vendor-specific
    - Price: vendor-specific
    - Stock: from vendor warehouse
    - Metadata: 
      - vendor_id
      - min_order_quantity
      - delivery_time

Warehouses:
  - One per vendor location
  - Linked to shipping zones
  - Stock tracking per warehouse

User Types:
  - Retailers (buyers)
  - Wholesalers (vendors) 
  - Platform admins
  - Drivers (external system)
```

## üí° Critical Implementation Decisions

### 1. Multi-Vendor Product Model
**Decision**: Use Product Variants for vendor offers
```graphql
Product: "Sugar 25kg"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Variant 1: RidaMart - $10
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Variant 2: Vendor A - $9
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Variant 3: Vendor B - $11
```
**Rationale**: Leverages existing Saleor structure, enables price comparison

### 2. Regional Configuration
**Decision**: Use Channel metadata + custom service
```python
# Custom service for sub-regional logic
class RegionalService:
    def get_available_products(channel, region, sub_region):
        # Filter products based on vendor coverage
        # Apply regional pricing rules
        # Check delivery availability
```
**Rationale**: Maintains Saleor structure while adding needed flexibility

### 3. Wallet Implementation
**Decision**: Custom payment plugin with balance tracking
```python
class WalletPlugin(BasePlugin):
    - Track user balances
    - Handle top-ups from external wallets
    - Process internal transfers
    - Generate transaction history
```
**Rationale**: Required for Sudan market, no suitable existing solution

### 4. Order Modification Flow
**Decision**: State machine with approval workflow
```
Order Placed ‚Üí Vendor Review ‚Üí Price/Availability Change? 
    ‚Üì Yes                          ‚Üì No
Buyer Approval Required        Process Order
    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
Accept/Reject               Fulfillment
```
**Rationale**: Handles hyperinflation and inventory issues

## üîë Success Factors & Risks

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Vendor onboarding simplicity** - Must be easy for non-technical users
2. **Mobile-first design** - Primary interface for all users
3. **Offline capability** - Handle connectivity issues
4. **Price flexibility** - Daily price updates capability
5. **Local payment support** - Wallet system operational

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| 6-week timeline | High | Focus on true MVP, defer nice-to-haves |
| Sudan connectivity | High | Offline-capable apps, SMS fallback |
| Hyperinflation | High | Price modification workflow, daily updates |
| Vendor adoption | Medium | Simple onboarding, training support |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Use Saleor defaults where possible |
