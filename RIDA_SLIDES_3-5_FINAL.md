## SLIDE 3: Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

**Title:** Rida Technologies' Key Challenges

```
ðŸ”´ Vendors can't manage their own catalogs digitally - the goal is replacing WhatsApp/Excel with a unified B2B marketplace connecting Sudan and Saudi Arabia.

â€¢ No digital catalog management system
  [EXCALIDRAW: "Vendor management of their own catalog" - Main Obstacle]
  â€¢ Everything on WhatsApp groups and Excel sheets â†’ retailers waste hours finding products, vendors lose sales

â€¢ Price competition is impossible
  [EXCALIDRAW: "ridamart offer: 5$" vs "X vendor offer: 4.5$"]
  â€¢ Same sugar sold at different prices but hidden â†’ retailers overpay 20%, no market efficiency

â€¢ Sudan has zero payment infrastructure  
  [EXCALIDRAW: "Wallet = own payment solution" - Key Outcome]
  â€¢ No cards, limited banks, cash trucks dangerous â†’ must build wallet from scratch with P2P top-ups

â€¢ Daily price changes break orders
  [APPROACH DOC: "Order modification after placement" requirement]
  â€¢ Hyperinflation means yesterday's price wrong today â†’ need approval workflow or 30% orders fail
