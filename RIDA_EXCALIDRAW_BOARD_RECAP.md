# Rida Technologies - Excalidraw Board Recap & Analysis

## Board Overview

The Excalidraw board from the Saleor discovery session captures the key architecture decisions, requirements, and flow for Rida Technologies' B2B marketplace platform. The board is organized into several sections: Outcomes, Obstacles, Requirements, and Architecture Flow.

## 🎯 Key Outcomes (Left Section)

### Core Outcomes Identified:
1. **B2B Marketplace**
2. **Multi-vendor setup**
3. **Integration with headless logistics** (onro & "uber for x")
4. **Multiple countries support** (divided into regions with different policies)
5. **Wallet = own payment solution**
6. **Cash on delivery**
7. **Multiple payment providers** (including local ones, p2p wallets)

### Platform Vision:
- **"Uber for X" ridesharing** - Their internal platform
- **"Rida will be the first user of their platform"** - Dog-fooding approach

## ❌ Obstacles (Right Section)

### Key Challenges:
1. **Vendor management of their own catalog**
2. **Marketplace orchestrator**
3. **Customer (retailers) who own a wholesale**

## 📋 Main Requirements (Center-Yellow Post-its)

### Critical Questions & Risks:
1. **"What do you want to integrate with?"**
2. **"Main risks of the project?"**
3. **"What was causing problems in the past?"**

## 🏗️ Architecture & Features (Center-Pink Section)

### Timeline & MVP:
- **"6 weeks from now to have an MVP"**
- **"a couple of retailers"**
- **"1 country"**
- **"integrating with onro"**

### Technical Stack:
- **"startup building superapp"**
- **"previously ride-sharing app in africa"**
- **"products: 25kg of sugar"**
- **"the future (e.g. electronics)"**
- **"other products"**
- **"ridamart offer: 5$"**
- **"X vendor offer: 4.5$"**
- **"sugar"**
- **"offers (products)"**

## 🔄 User Flow (Bottom Section - Green)

### Vendor/Wholesaler Journey:
1. **Vendors have their own warehouses** (can map to 1)
2. **Vendor/wholesaler are registered for regions**

## 📊 Architecture Components

### Left Side Components:
- **B2B**
- **Multi-vendor setup**
- **Vendors have their own warehouses** (but we can map to 1)

### Center Components:
- **Multiple countries divided in multiple regions** that affect:
  - Product availability
  - Vendor registration
  - Etc.

### Right Side Components:
- **Vendor managing their own catalog**
- **Marketplace orchestrator**
- **Customer (retailers) who own a wholesale**

## 🔄 Integration Points

The board shows clear integration requirements:
1. **Headless logistics integration** (onro & uber for x)
2. **Payment systems integration**:
   - Wallet (own solution)
   - Cash on delivery
   - Multiple payment providers
   - P2P wallets

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

From the board, the scaling approach is clear:
1. **Start**: MVP with couple of retailers in 1 country
2. **Expand**: Multiple countries with sub-regions
3. **Products**: Start with basics (sugar, 25kg items) → Electronics and other products
4. **Vendors**: Multi-vendor from the start with price competition

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions from Board

### Multi-Vendor Price Competition:
- Same product (e.g., sugar) offered by multiple vendors
- Different prices: Ridamart ($5) vs X vendor ($4.5)
- Customer choice based on price and other factors

### Regional Model:
- Countries → Regions → Sub-regions
- Each level affects product availability, vendor registration, pricing

### Integration Architecture:
- Headless approach for maximum flexibility
- Multiple integration points (logistics, payments)
- Own platform (uber for x) as infrastructure

## 🚀 Implementation Priorities (Based on Board)

### Phase 1 (6 weeks - MVP):
1. Basic B2B marketplace
2. Single country operation
3. Integration with onro
4. Limited retailers and products
5. Basic vendor management

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP):
1. Multi-country expansion
2. Full regional/sub-regional support
3. Wallet system implementation
4. Additional payment providers
5. Expanded product catalog

## 🔗 Alignment with Approach Documents

### Confirmed Requirements from Board:
✅ **B2B Marketplace** - Central focus
✅ **Multi-vendor** - Core requirement with price competition
✅ **6-week timeline** - Aggressive MVP schedule
✅ **Integration needs** - Headless logistics (onro + uber4x)
✅ **Payment complexity** - Wallet + COD + multiple providers
✅ **Regional structure** - Countries → regions with policies

### Additional Insights from Board:
- **Vendor warehouse mapping** - "can map to 1" suggests simplification strategy
- **Product examples** - 25kg sugar as initial product type
- **Price competition visualization** - Clear example of multi-vendor pricing
- **"First user" approach** - Rida using their own platform
