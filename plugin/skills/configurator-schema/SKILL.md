# Configurator Schema

## Overview

Your store configuration lives in a single `config.yml` file. Each section defines a type of entity (channels, products, categories, etc.) using a declarative YAML format that Configurator syncs with your Saleor instance.

## When to Use

- "What does config.yml look like?"
- "What fields are required for a product/channel/category?"
- "Why is my config failing validation?"
- "What's the difference between slug-based and name-based entities?"
- "How do I reference one entity from another?"
- When NOT designing product types or choosing attributes -- use `product-modeling` instead

## File Structure

```yaml
# config.yml - Top-level structure
shop:           # Store-wide settings (singleton)
channels:       # Sales channels (slug-based)
productTypes:   # Product type definitions (name-based)
attributes:     # Attribute definitions (name-based)
categories:     # Category hierarchy (slug-based)
collections:    # Product collections (slug-based)
products:       # Product definitions (slug-based)
taxClasses:     # Tax classifications (name-based)
shippingZones:  # Shipping zone definitions (name-based)
warehouses:     # Warehouse definitions (slug-based)
menus:          # Navigation menus (slug-based)
pageTypes:      # Page type definitions (name-based)
pages:          # Content pages (slug-based)
```

## Entity Identification

Configurator matches your local config to remote entities using an identifier field. This is either `slug` or `name` depending on entity type:

| Identifier | Entity Types |
|------------|-------------|
| **slug** | channels, categories, collections, products, warehouses, menus, pages |
| **name** | productTypes, pageTypes, attributes, taxClasses, shippingZones |

**Important**: Changing a slug or name creates a NEW entity instead of updating the existing one.

## Common Entity Examples

### Channel

```yaml
channels:
  - name: "US Store"
    slug: "us-store"
    currencyCode: USD
    defaultCountry: US
    isActive: true
```

### Product Type

```yaml
productTypes:
  - name: "T-Shirt"
    isShippingRequired: true
    productAttributes:
      - name: "Brand"
        type: DROPDOWN
    variantAttributes:
      - name: "Size"
        type: DROPDOWN
        values: [{ name: "S" }, { name: "M" }, { name: "L" }]
      - name: "Color"
        type: SWATCH
```

### Product

```yaml
products:
  - name: "Classic T-Shirt"
    slug: "classic-t-shirt"
    productType: "T-Shirt"
    category: "clothing/t-shirts"
    variants:
      - sku: "TSHIRT-S-RED"
        attributes:
          Size: "S"
          Color: "Red"
        channelListings:
          - channel: "us-store"
            price: 29.99
```

### Category (hierarchical)

```yaml
categories:
  - name: "Electronics"
    slug: "electronics"
    children:
      - name: "Phones"
        slug: "phones"
```

## Attribute Types

Saleor supports these attribute input types: DROPDOWN, MULTISELECT, SWATCH, BOOLEAN, PLAIN_TEXT, RICH_TEXT, NUMERIC, DATE, DATE_TIME, FILE, REFERENCE.

For detailed guidance on choosing the right type, see the `product-modeling` skill.

## Validation Rules

1. **Required fields** -- each entity type has required fields (e.g., channels need `name`, `slug`, `currencyCode`)
2. **Unique identifiers** -- slugs/names must be unique within their entity type
3. **Valid references** -- cross-entity references must match (e.g., a product's `productType` must match a defined product type name)
4. **Currency codes** -- valid ISO 4217 (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
5. **Country codes** -- valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (US, DE, GB, etc.)

## Entity Dependencies

Entities depend on each other and must exist in the right order:

```
Level 0 (independent):  shop, channels, productTypes, pageTypes, taxClasses, shippingZones
Level 1 (needs L0):     categories, warehouses, attributes
Level 2 (needs L1):     collections, pages
Level 3 (needs L2):     products, menus
```

Configurator handles deployment order automatically, but understanding dependencies helps when troubleshooting validation errors.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Changing a slug or name to "rename" an entity | This creates a new entity. To rename, delete the old one and create new. |
| Duplicate slugs within an entity type | Each slug must be unique. Check for copy-paste errors. |
| Product references a nonexistent productType | The `productType` field must exactly match a `name` in your `productTypes` section. |
| Missing required fields | Check the error message -- it tells you which field is missing. |
| Products defined before their productType | Not a YAML order issue (Configurator handles order), but the referenced type must exist in the file. |

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful slugs** -- `womens-summer-dresses` not `cat-123`
2. **Consistent naming** -- match display names to slugs when possible
3. **Comment complex sections** -- use YAML comments for documentation
4. **Version control** -- track config.yml in git
